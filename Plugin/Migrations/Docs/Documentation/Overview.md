Overview
========

As an application is developed, changes to the database may be required, and managing that in teams can get extremely difficult. The **Migrations** plugin enables you to share and coordinate database changes in an iterative manner, removing the complexity of handling these changes.

* **Console:** The console script allows you to run migrations up and down.
* **Installation:** Migrations can also be run programmatically via an installer script.
* **ORM:** The **Migrations** plugin makes use of the *CakePHP* ORM and supports all databases provided by the framework.
